#NOTICED

 AS you see the code has no implemeted all helpers, but with this code you have all basic protocols to comunicate with APM.
 
 I stopped development to here, because i discovered a new way to transport telemetry data side by side, and it's will be release when URUS System development finish.
 You will be updated about this if you want following the development at https://github.com/hiro2233
 
 All URUS System and new URUS Protocol will be a member project and a part of Ardupilot Development.
 
 
#TESTING

 There is an example in example path to test te unit, it's tested with Embarcadero RAD Studio Berlin in multidevice mode with windows and android.
 I think the unit will work with LAZARUS with little modifications.
